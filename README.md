# CodingCurriculumWebsite
This is a website that David Stepanov and I made in our first year of computer science at UCL. The aim of this website is to teach the basics of Arduino, a microcontroller that can be used for many projects. By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to go out and do your own projects by using other documentation. Although we made our best effort to have the turorial self-contained, we have provided sets of challenges and external references for further reading. 

# How to use the website

1. Clone the directory using your preferred method or extract the zipfile
2. In a terminal, change your directory to the one you just cloned or downloaded
3. Start an http server locally from the terminal (staying in that same directory which is the project's root directory)
``` bash

#If you have python3 installed, you can use the following command:
$ python -m http.server

```
4. In your browser, navigate to localhost:8000 (note that the port number after ":" could change depending on the server you are using)
